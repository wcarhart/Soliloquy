blurb: Portfolio, personal website, full-stack web app
description: As much as I hate to admit it, most average people don't get too excited about CLIs. I'm sure every developer at some point has spent weeks on a cool command line utility, only to have the uninitiated proclaim that's it? So, I decided to build willcarh.art, the world's greatest personal website, per me. And, as an aspiring Pythonista, I wrote it in Python. Please enjoy :)
